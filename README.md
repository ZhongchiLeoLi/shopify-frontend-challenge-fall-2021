A website for users to search movies and choose 5 of their favourite movies for nomination.

## Built with:

* TypeScript
* React.js
* Chakra UI

## Features:

* Fully responsive layout

* Live search update when user is typing (debounced by 700ms to prevent request DDoSing)
* Pagination for search results

* Change pagination to inifite scroll to reduce number of clicks required for page navigation, providing a more frictionless browsing experience
